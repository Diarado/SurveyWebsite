Purpose of Study   The goal of this research is to find out how text-based generative language models, such as ChatGPT, and Text-to-Image Generation Models, such as Dall-E, take different roles in visual imagery creativity. Furthermore, we intend to discover the limitations of each method and ways to overcome them.

 

Procedures Essentially, we will ask participants to complete the following drawing task. It does not require fancy drawing skills.


	We will provide seven kinds of different unfinished abstract simple lines (e.g., spiral lines). 
	Then we will ask participants to ideate many mental images that are related to such shapes. For example, from a spiral shape, you might produce snails, sea shells, dizziness, etc. We will encourage participants to produce as many mental images as possible without using synonyms. 
	Once you finish ideating mental images, then you will choose one mental image and then use that to finish the drawing in the most creative way.

 

Participant Requirements To participate in this interview, you should be proficient in English, and aged over 18 years old.

 

Risks and Benefits With respect to benefits, the interview might help the participants to experience state-of-the-art generative AI models.  This might help them to understand modern AI technologies better. Generative AI models are not perfect, therefore there is a risk of generating unwanted content that might irritate participants. However, this risk is low since our drawing task does not involve any violent content.

 

Voluntary Participation And Right To Withdraw Participation in this interview is voluntary, and you can decide to withdraw at any time without any penalty. 

 

Compensation If you willingly participate in the interview, you will earn a $12/hour. There is 70 minutes time limitation. 

 

Privacy and Confidentiality The only identifying information based on your participation in this interview will be your information provided via Prolific. We note that this could be linked to your offline self, so you might consider this before deciding to participate in the interview. The identifiable information will not be shared with anyone outside the research team and will only be used for research purposes.

 

Contact Information If you have any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this interview, you may contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Human Participants at 607-255-5138 or access their website at http://www.irb.cornell.edu. You may also report your concerns or complaints anonymously through Ethicspoint online at www.hotline.cornell.edu or by calling toll free at 1-866-293-3077. Ethicspoint is an independent organization that serves as a liaison between the University and the person bringing the complaint so that anonymity can be ensured. You will be given a copy of this form to keep for your records.

 

Statement of Consent By saying yes, you indicate that you are 18 years of age or older, that you voluntarily agree to participate in this interview, and that you understand the information in this consent form. You have not waived any legal rights you otherwise would have as a participant in this interview.","What is your Prolific ID?
